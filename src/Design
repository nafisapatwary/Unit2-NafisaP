LinearEquation Class:

Instance Variables:
    private int x1 - This variable represents the x coordinate of the first pair
    private int y1 - This variable represents the y coordinate of the first pair
    private int x2 - This variable represents the x coordinate of the second pair
    private int y2 - This variable represents the y coordinate of the second pair

Methods:
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)
        This method is the constructor that will take the user input as it's argument and create a Linear equation
        object and also give the instance variables values

    public String slopeAsFraction()
        This method will return the slope as a 'fraction' by calculating y2-y1 and assigning it to slopeNum, then it
        will calculate x2-x1 and assign it to slopeDen, then it will return a string using those variables to add the
        "/" to make it a 'fraction'

    public double slopeAsDecimal()
        This method will calculate the slope between the 2 points by dividing the difference of y2 and y1 by the
        difference of x2 and x1. It will return the slope as a double (needed for later calculations)

    public double yIntercept()
        This method will calculate the y intercept of the equation

    public double distance()
        This method will calculate and return the distance between the 2 points as a double
        Math.sqrt(((Math.POW((x2-x1), 2) + ((Math.POW(y2-y1), 2)))

    public String createLinearEquation()
        This method will return a string with the slope and the y intercept in y = mx + b form

    public String distance()
        This method will return a string with the distance between the points

    public String solveForPoint(double x3)
            This method will use the x3 value that the user inputs and solve for the y coordinate associated using the slope
            and y intercept
            Then it will return a string with the x and y values in the coordinate point format

    public String toString()
        This method will return a string that will be used to display the following information
           - First pair of coords
           - Second pair of coords
           - Slope as a decimal
           - Y intercept
           - Equation of line in y = mx + b form
           - Distance between points




EquationRunner Class:
1. Ask user to enter first coordinate point
2. Ask user to enter second coordinate point
3. Use string methods (indexOf and substrings) to create new strings that are just the x and y values
4. Parse through strings to get values as doubles
5. Create LinearEquation object with constructor
6. Call calculateSlope method and assign it to a slope variable
7. Call calculateYIntercept method and assign it to a double y intercept variable
8. Call calculateDistance method and assign it to a double distance variable
9. Call toString method to print information
10. Ask user for another x value (x3)
11. Call solveForPoint method to print new coordinate point
